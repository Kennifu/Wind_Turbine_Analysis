# Wind Turbine Analysis

Statistical analysis and visualization on United States Wind Turbine Data. Our goal is to answer the questions:

1. What is the landscape of wind farms and turbines for the contiguous United States?
2. What is the landscape of megawatt production across the contiguous United states?
3. Are there seasonal trends by state or region?
4. Are there significant increases in megawatt production with retrofitting?

This project was done in collaboration with:

+ Sean Birch (sbirch@andrew.cmu.edu)
+ Xiaohan Liu (xiaohanliu@cmu.edu)
+ Alan Zhu (yixuanz2@andrew.cmu.edu)
